       <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        My name is Ben Hoang, and I am from Bothell, Washington, where I have spent most of my life and continue to reside.
        As a proud Vietnamese-American and second-generation college student, I carry the legacy of my family’s resilience while forging my own path.
        Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems, 
        a field that aligns with my interest in solving complex problems and creating efficient systems.
        My short-term goal is to land an internship that will allow me to apply what I’ve learned in the classroom to real-world situations.
        Long-term, I aspire to build a fulfilling career leveraging my degree to drive innovation and success.
        A challenge that has shaped me is striving to live up to the success of my parents. 
        Their accomplishments inspired me but also created a sense of pressure.
        Over time, I developed the perspective that my journey is unique and equally valuable, which helped me overcome this struggle. 
        This experience instilled in me perseverance and confidence, qualities I value deeply and apply to both academics and life.
        When I’m not focused on my studies, I enjoy snowboarding during the winter and early spring. 
        It’s a hobby that challenges me physically and mentally while offering a sense of freedom. I also enjoy going to the gym which offers the same feeling.
        To unwind, I often watch YouTube, TV shows, movies, or listen to music, which helps me recharge.
        With my determination and passion for learning, I am eager to contribute meaningfully to my field and create a positive impact wherever my path leads.
