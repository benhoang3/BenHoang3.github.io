        I am an ambitious and self-motivated student pursuing a Bachelor degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems at the University of Washington.
        With a GPA of 3.57 and an expected graduation date of June 2026, I am dedicated to excelling in business processes and information systems management.
        My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation through coursework in Financial and Managerial Accounting, Business Law, Computer Programming, Software Engineering, SQL, and data management. 
        I have applied some this knowledge to hands-on projects, such as conducting an in-depth accounting analysis of Costco, where I evaluated its business model, financial statements, and cost management strategies. 
        Additionally, I developed a search engine using Java that enables users to locate files efficiently based on user-defined criteria.
        I bring technical proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite and Java, combined with strong analytical, problem-solving, and time management skills.
        I thrive in collaborative environments and value clear, effective communication, whether working as part of a team or independently.
        I am eager to secure an internship to gain practical experience in management information systems.
        My goal is to contribute to innovative projects, enhance operational efficiency, and apply data-driven strategies to real-world challenges.
        I am passionate about learning and growing professionally, and I am excited to bring my skills and determination to an organization that values innovation and excellence.
